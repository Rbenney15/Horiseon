Refactor for client; Horiseon

I was brought in to help refactor the code for the client and bring the working code up to accessibility standards.

Adjustments I made:
- Updated semantic HTML elements to more specific element names (header, footer, section, article, and nav)
- Added accesible alt attributes to each image
- Cleaned up the ordering of the heading attributes to ensure they were in proper descending order
- Adjusted the title element to reflect the name of the client to assist in increased visibility

The project is currently deployed at: https://rbenney15.github.io/Horiseon/
